CARINGMIND APP STATE:
- Cyberpunk consciousness companion app
- Core aesthetic: Matrix-like green (#00FF00) on black, circuit patterns, glowing effects
- App icon: Cyber green eyes with circuit patterns
- Key design elements: Monospaced fonts, pulsing animations, tech terminology

COMPLETED:
- Splash screen with cyber styling
- Initial onboarding flow through step transitions
- Name input view with voice recording (requires styling refinement)
- Visualization of "LIFE = DATA, MOMENTS + THOUGHTS + EMOTIONS"
- Moving from text to more engaging visual representation

KEY PRINCIPLES:
- Keep UI dark and sophisticated
- Use consistent cyber-green color scheme
- Maintain ambient animations (pulse, glow, circuit patterns)
- Transform traditional UI elements into cyberpunk versions
- Do NOT Use tech-inspired language (e.g., "INITIALIZE" vs "Start"), this is for the consumer, we want them comfortable

STYLING GUIDELINES:
- Font: .system(size: XX, weight: .bold, design: .monospaced)
- Primary color: Color(hex: "#00FF00")
- Backgrounds: Black with subtle circuit animations
- Buttons: Black bg + green border/text or green bg + black text
- Animations: Smooth, continuous, ambient

When you reinitialize me, ask me to continue styling the MOMENTS + THOUGHTS + EMOTIONS visualization to feel more cyberpunk and visually engaging while maintaining the app's established aesthetic.
