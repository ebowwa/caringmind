//  Created by Elijah Arbee on 10/26/24.
//
// NOTE: this product is meant to listen 24/7 it uses the openaudio which allows for processing of audio from devices and storing, post requests, websocket, audio playing controls, local audio measurement, etc
// - this app should always be recording, it may be recording for local storage, for batch uploads to server, or for a live-streaming websocket
// - this functionality should not be managed by views, but can be modified, i.e., switch to websocket, send data to server, playbacks, viewing transcriptions, data, etc
// NOTE: this script was updated to include a google sign in which as of now does nothing, it works, the user can sign in with their google account but otherwise this feature has no other extension
