# API Documentation: `/messages` Endpoint

## Overview

The `/messages` endpoint allows clients to create and send messages to the backend for processing. Depending on the request parameters, responses can be either streamed in real-time or returned as a complete response upon processing completion.

## Endpoint

- **URL:** `/messages`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Description:** Creates a message based on the provided input and returns the generated content. Supports both streaming and non-streaming responses.

## Request

### Headers

- `Content-Type: application/json`

### Request Body

The request body must be a JSON object adhering to the `CreateMessageRequest` schema.

#### `CreateMessageRequest` Schema

| Field       | Type        | Required | Description                                           |
|-------------|-------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `max_tokens`| `integer`   | Yes      | The maximum number of tokens to generate.             |
| `messages`  | `List[Message]` | Yes  | A list of messages constituting the conversation.     |
| `model`     | `string`    | Yes      | The model identifier to use for message generation.   |
| `stream`    | `boolean`   | No       | If `true`, the response will be streamed. Defaults to `false`. |
| `system`    | `string`    | No       | Optional system prompt to guide the model's behavior. |

#### `Message` Schema

Each message in the `messages` list must follow the `Message` schema:

| Field    | Type     | Required | Description                      |
|----------|----------|----------|----------------------------------|
| `role`   | `string` | Yes      | The role of the message sender (e.g., "user", "assistant"). |
| `content`| `string` | Yes      | The content of the message.       |

### Example Request

```json
{
  "max_tokens": 150,
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Hello, how are you?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I'm good, thank you! How can I assist you today?"
    }
  ],
  "model": "claude-v1",
  "stream": false,
  "system": "You are a helpful assistant."
}
```

## Response

The response format depends on the `stream` parameter in the request.

### Non-Streaming Response

When `stream` is set to `false` or omitted, the response is returned as a complete JSON object once processing is complete.

#### Response Schema

| Field   | Type    | Description                             |
|---------|---------|-----------------------------------------|
| `content` | `string` | The generated message content.         |
| `usage`   | `object` | Token usage information.               |
| `usage.input_tokens` | `integer` | Number of tokens in the input messages. |
| `usage.output_tokens` | `integer` | Number of tokens generated in the response. |

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "content": "I'm here to help! What would you like to know today?",
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 25,
    "output_tokens": 15
  }
}
```

### Streaming Response

When `stream` is set to `true`, the response is streamed as Server-Sent Events (SSE). This allows clients to receive parts of the response in real-time as they are generated.

#### Response Format

The streamed data consists of multiple SSE-formatted events. Each event has an `event` type and associated `data`.

##### Event Types

- `content_block_start`: Indicates the start of a content block.
- `content_block_delta`: Provides incremental updates to the content block.
- `content_block_stop`: Marks the end of a content block.
- `message_delta`: Provides incremental updates to the message.
- `message_stop`: Marks the end of the message.
- `error`: Indicates an error has occurred during streaming.

#### Example Stream

```
event: content_block_start
data: {"type": "content_block_start", "timestamp": "2024-10-02T12:00:00Z"}

event: message_delta
data: {"type": "message_delta", "content": "I'm here to"}

event: message_delta
data: {"type": "message_delta", "content": "I'm here to help!"}

event: message_stop
data: {"type": "message_stop"}

event: usage
data: {"input_tokens": 25, "output_tokens": 15}
```

## Error Handling

If an error occurs during the processing of the request, the API will respond with an appropriate HTTP status code and a descriptive error message.

### Common Errors

- **500 Internal Server Error**
  
  - **Description:** An unexpected error occurred on the server.
  - **Response Schema:**
  
    | Field  | Type   | Description            |
    |--------|--------|------------------------|
    | `detail` | `string` | Description of the error. |

  - **Example Response:**

    ```json
    {
      "detail": "An unexpected error occurred while processing your request."
    }
    ```

- **400 Bad Request**
  
  - **Description:** The request payload is malformed or missing required fields.
  - **Response Schema:**
  
    | Field  | Type   | Description            |
    |--------|--------|------------------------|
    | `detail` | `string` | Description of the validation error. |

  - **Example Response:**

    ```json
    {
      "detail": "Field 'messages' is required."
    }
    ```

## Logging

The endpoint utilizes logging to record significant events and errors:

- **INFO Level:**
  - Receipt of requests (if uncommented).
  - Whether a streaming or non-streaming response was requested.
  - Details of streaming events.

- **ERROR Level:**
  - Any exceptions that occur during request processing or streaming.

Logs are outputted in a structured format to aid in debugging and monitoring.

## Dependencies

The endpoint relies on the following packages and modules:

- **FastAPI:** Web framework for building APIs.
- **Anthropic:** Client library for interacting with the Anthropic API.
- **Pydantic:** Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **Logging:** Python's built-in logging module for logging events.
- **JSON:** For handling JSON data.

Ensure that all dependencies are installed and properly configured, especially the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the `env_config` module.

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication:** Ensure that appropriate authentication mechanisms are in place to protect the endpoint from unauthorized access.
- **Input Validation:** The endpoint uses Pydantic models to validate incoming data, preventing malformed requests.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to protect against abuse and ensure fair usage.

## Conclusion

The `/messages` endpoint provides a flexible interface for creating and processing messages, supporting both real-time streaming and complete responses. Proper error handling and logging ensure reliability and ease of maintenance.
