# Environment and Multipart Utilities
python-dotenv         # Manages environment variables
python-multipart      # Parses multipart form data (necessary for file uploads in FastAPI)

# ASGI Server and WebSocket Libraries
uvicorn[standard]     # ASGI server for FastAPI in development
uvicorn               # Base version; may not need both `uvicorn` and `uvicorn[standard]`
websockets            # WebSocket support; might be redundant if `wsproto` covers all needs
wsproto               # Low-level WebSocket protocol library, check redundancy with `websockets`

# FastAPI and Related Libraries
pydantic              # Data validation and settings management for FastAPI (in multiple areas)
fastapi               # API framework, main dependency

# Gunicorn Server (Commented for Optional Use in Production)
gunicorn              # Production-grade server; redundant if `uvicorn` works well alone

# AI Inference and Token Counting Libraries
ollama                # AI inference provider for image models (Falcon, etc.)
openai                # OpenAI API for language models
anthropic             # Anthropics language models
fal-client            # AI inference provider for image models, likely overlaps with `ollama`
tiktoken              # Token counting for OpenAI/Anthropic APIs

# Speech and Audio Processing
pyannote.audio        # Speaker diarization, possibly overkill if only minimal audio processing is needed
torch                 # Core PyTorch, a dependency of `pyannote.audio`
torchaudio            # Audio utilities for PyTorch, likely required if `pyannote.audio` used

# ngrok for Local Development Tunneling
ngrok                 # Provides a tunnel to localhost for testing

# Google Generative AI
google-generativeai   # Specific to Googleâ€™s Generative AI; confirm API requirements

# Database Utilities and Async ORM
sqlalchemy            # Core SQL ORM, check redundancy with `databases` or `asyncpg` if only one ORM is needed
databases             # Async SQL toolkit, redundant if `sqlalchemy` alone suffices
asyncpg               # PostgreSQL driver, necessary if using PostgreSQL (but could be redundant with `databases`)
aiosqlite             # Async SQLite support, likely redundant with `databases` if both SQLite and PostgreSQL are used

# Asynchronous File Handling
aiofiles              # Async file I/O for handling files within FastAPI

# Additional Parsing and Magic Libraries
python-magic          # File type identification
beautifulsoup4        # For web scraping; check if usage is frequent or if a lighter library suffices

# Async Telegram Bot
aiogram               # Async Telegram Bot framework; only retain if Telegram bot functionality is essential

# Libraries Removed or Commented Out
# aioredis            # Removed; reconsider if async Redis caching is required
# firebase-admin      # Removed; only include if Firebase services become necessary
# hydra-core          # Upgrade recommended if configuration complexity increases
# nemo_toolkit        # Check necessity for additional audio models
# huggingface_hub     # Upgrade recommended for Hugging Face API, though redundancy with `torch` possible
# moviepy             # For video editing, only include if multimedia features are required
