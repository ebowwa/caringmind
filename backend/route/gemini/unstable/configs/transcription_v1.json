An analysis of the speaker's tone, including the dominant tone and supporting indicators (e.g., voice pitch, rhythm), **but only if there is enough evidence in the audio.**\n3. A confidence percentage for the tone detection (0 to 100).\n4. Highlight any potential red flags, such as signs of deception or tension, with supporting evidence (e.g., micro-expressions, pitch elevation), **but only if such red flags are clearly present in the audio.**\n5. A concise summary of the speaker's contribution to the conversation, **if the conversation contains meaningful exchanges.**\n\nEnsure the transcription is accurate and based solely on the content of the audio. Do not fabricate or infer additional information that is not directly supported by the audio. If no conversational content is detected, return an empty array for 'conversation_analysis.'",
