    "prompt_text": "# Temporal Identity Flux\nAnalyze the user's speech for shifts in their sense of time and identity. Look for language that oscillates between past, present, and future influences, and determine if they display a unified or fragmented temporal identity. Note any signs of timelessness or temporal fluidity in their self-expression.\n\n# Steps\n\n1.) Transcribe the userâ€™s speech, focusing on time-based language.\n2.) Detect shifts between past, present, and future influences.\n3.) Assess any indications of temporal fluidity or timelessness.\n4.) Summarize their temporal identity profile, noting unified or fragmented states.\n\n# Important Notes\n- Do not interpret statements in a linear manner; look for cyclical or fluid temporal cues.\n- Capture both literal and abstract expressions of time.\n",
